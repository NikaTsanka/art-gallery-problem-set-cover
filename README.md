#### [Art gallery problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_gallery_problem) GUI ([Xlib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xlib)) simulation using the [Set Cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_cover_problem) approximation.

Input: (obstacles.txt) The file consists of lines, each line describes one orthogonal polygon as obstacles, by giving sequence of its vertices range 10 to 490, eg., *(10,10) (50,10) (50,100) (40,100) (40,20) (10,20)*

Approximation is repeated until at most 5% of the gallery is not covered.

Results: The chosen guard positions are red dots, the covered areas are blue dots, *roses are red, violets are blue, I'm seeing a future filled with me and :pizza: jk* :smile: and not covered areas black.
